COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID: CT04DG1511

DOMAIN: C PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION: TO BUILD A SIMPLE LEXICAL ANALYZER IN C THAT:

READS A SOURCE CODE FILE (MYFILE.TXT)

IDENTIFIES AND PRINTS:

KEYWORDS (E.G., INT, IF, RETURN)

IDENTIFIERS (E.G., VARIABLE NAMES LIKE A, MAIN)

OPERATORS (E.G., +, -, =, ETC.)

EDITOR : VS CODE

COMPILER : C COMPILER

LANGUAGE : C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

FILE : code.c

THE COMPILER DESIGN BASICS PROGRAM WRITTEN IN C SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMS THE BASIC TASK OF TOKENIZING INPUT FROM A SOURCE CODE FILE. IT ACCURATELY CLASSIFIES 

KEYWORDS, IDENTIFIERS, AND OPERATORS BY SCANNING THE FILE CHARACTER BY CHARACTER. THIS PROJECT PROVIDES A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF:

HOW LEXICAL ANALYSIS IS DONE IN COMPILERS,

HOW TO USE FILE HANDLING, STRING MANIPULATION, AND CHARACTER TESTING IN C.
